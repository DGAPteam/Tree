# Alignment
The algorithms were implemented by myself and not exactly the same as wiki tells.
But I kept the main idea the same everywhere, I just modified some parameters. 
You can find my implementation [here](https://github.com/poolsar42/Tree/blob/master/alignment.py)
# How to use .ipynb file:
    1. Start project.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook

    3. Run your optional alignment algorirht
    4. Wait...
# How to use .py file:
    1. Start main.py file in console
    2. Write in console "python3 (or python) 'filename'.py -i 'path to input file'.fas -o 'output name'
